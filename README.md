# ESP32-BME280-WiFi
This is a simple sketch I created using Heltec Wifi_kit_32, which came with a built-in led, and OLED display. This Sketch provides a reading of the data of the Bosch BME280 sensor, and provides a visual feedback via OLED display, and also sends the data to thingspeak so we can monitor via web.

I used Arduino IDE for this sketch, sure it can be done better, but i'm still learning.
maybe helpful for someone
